Filmoteca is a website for movies. Popular movies are loaded on the main page, pagination is implemented. It is also possible to search for movies by name. Clicking on a movie opens a modal window with information about the movie. There is a function of adding a movie to the list to watch or to watched. In the section "My library" there are movies added to watch or watched.
